Dataset with images of 1) cloud, 2) fog, 3) rain, 4) clear and 5) snow.

Model 1: Standard CNN model: conv-> 2x pool-> conv-> 2x pool-> conv-> pool -> FC
90% accuracy with 300 epochs of learning rate 0.0001.


Model 2: Resnet CNN model with 3x resnet blocks -> FC.
92% accuracy with 200 epochs. Learning rate 0.0001.


Datasets used was an amalgation between https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijaygiitk/multiclass-weather-dataset/
and https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jehanbhathena/weather-dataset


Results may be improved by balancing the number of images for each category in the dataset.
Model 2 had significantly faster training compared to model 1's standard CNN.


The confusion matrices shows the correctly guessed images (diagonal), the model's guess (columns) with corresponding correct answers (rows).
The loss plot shows the second model's loss (y-axis) per epoch (x-axis).
