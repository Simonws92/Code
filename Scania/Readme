A short project for Scania to classify weather images using various convolutional neural networks.

Main file: scania_assignment
Dependencies: scania_models, scania_data

scania_data:
1) Run this file to process images from a dataset of images to store as a list. This list will be saved as a pickle file.
New paths must be provided prior.

scania_assignment:
2) Run this file to load the pickle file of images, initiate and start training the model.

scania_models:
A file with two different CNN models which are used when called from scania_assignment.
