A short project for Scania to classify weather images using various convolutional neural networks.

Main file: scania_assignment
Dependencies: scania_models, scania_data

scania_data:
1) Run this file to process images from a dataset of images to store as a list. This list will be saved as a pickle file.
New paths must be provided prior.

scania_assignment:
2) Run this file to load the pickle file of images, initiate and start training the model.

scania_models:
A file with two different CNN models which are used when called from scania_assignment.

Dataset with images of 1) cloud, 2) fog, 3) rain, 4) clear and 5) snow.

Model 1: Standard CNN model: conv-> 2x pool-> conv-> 2x pool-> conv-> pool -> FC
90% accuracy with 300 epochs of learning rate 0.0001.


Model 2: Resnet CNN model with 3x resnet blocks -> FC.
92% accuracy with 200 epochs. Learning rate 0.0001.


Datasets used was an amalgation between https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijaygiitk/multiclass-weather-dataset/
and https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jehanbhathena/weather-dataset


Results may be improved by balancing the number of images for each category in the dataset.
Model 2 had significantly faster training compared to model 1's standard CNN.


The confusion matrices shows the correctly guessed images (diagonal), the model's guess (columns) with corresponding correct answers (rows).
The loss plot shows the second model's loss (y-axis) per epoch (x-axis).
